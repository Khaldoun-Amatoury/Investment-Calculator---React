# Investment Calculator App

This React app calculates the future value of a investment based on user-provided inputs. It includes input validation to ensure the duration is greater than zero.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Start the development server by running `npm run dev`.

## Code Overview

The app consists of three main components:

- `Header.jsx`: Displays the app's title.
- `UserInput.jsx`: Allows the user to enter their investment details.
- `Results.jsx`: Displays the calculated future value of the investment.
